    "Added CSS rule to explicitly hide the original textarea (#toml-editor { display: none; })",
    "Added cursor: text styling to .CodeMirror and .CodeMirror-scroll to ensure proper cursor display",
    "Wrapped CodeMirror initialization in this.$nextTick() to ensure DOM is fully ready",
    "Explicitly set readOnly: false in CodeMirror options during initialization",
    "Added this.editor.setOption('readOnly', false) after initialization as double-check",
    "Added this.editor.focus() after initialization to make editor immediately usable"
  ],
  "files_modified": [
    "pages/job_add.html"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The textarea was not explicitly hidden, causing potential overlay issues. Additionally, CodeMirror was being initialized before the DOM was fully ready (Alpine.js lifecycle timing). The lack of explicit readOnly: false configuration and the missing cursor styling also contributed to the read-only appearance."
