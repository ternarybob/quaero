# ASX Stocks Daily Analysis - Orchestrated Version
# =========================================================================
# Uses the OrchestratorWorker with Planner-Executor-Reviewer loop for
# dynamic, goal-based execution of stock analysis.
#
# KEY DIFFERENCES from static asx-stocks-daily.toml:
# - Single orchestrator step instead of multiple job_template steps
# - LLM-based planning decides which tools to call and in what order
# - Recovery logic if data collection fails
#
# VARIABLES:
# Global variables are declared once at job level in [config] section.
# The orchestrator reads these variables to know which stocks to analyze.

# Natural language goal - the LLM will plan how to achieve this
goal = """
Perform a comprehensive daily analysis of all ASX stocks in the variables list.

For EACH stock in the list:
1. Collect current market data (prices, volume, technical indicators)
2. Fetch recent ASX announcements
3. Search for financial news and analyst coverage
4. Analyze announcements for signal vs noise
5. Generate a stock summary with key metrics
6. Create a BUY/SELL/HOLD recommendation with conviction score

If data collection fails for any stock:
- Note the failure explicitly
- Attempt alternative data sources (web search)
- Continue with remaining stocks

Final output should include:
- Individual stock reports
- Summary table of all recommendations
- Any alerts for significant price movements or announcements
