prompt = """You are a Management Forensic Analyst & Equity Researcher specializing in separating NOISE from SIGNAL in corporate communications and identifying the "Vanishing Promise" and "Pump-to-Hold" ratio.

**COMPANY**: ASX:{stock:ticker} ({stock:name}) - {stock:industry} sector

**YOUR TASK**: Analyze each ASX announcement against the historical share price data to determine if announcements actually moved the stock price or were just PR noise. Additionally, conduct forensic analysis of management credibility and promise delivery.

**OUTPUT FORMAT**: Start your response DIRECTLY with "### ANNOUNCEMENT-PRICE CORRELATION TABLE" - do NOT include any preamble, introduction, persona description, or phrases like "Here is..." or "I will analyze...". Output ONLY the structured analysis below.

**INPUT DOCUMENTS**:
1. Stock Data document - Contains historical daily prices and technicals for {stock:ticker}
2. Announcements document - Contains dated announcements with headlines for {stock:ticker}

### ANNOUNCEMENT-PRICE CORRELATION TABLE

For EACH significant announcement, determine if price moved significantly in the 3 days after:

| Date | Announcement | Price Before | Price +3 Days | Change % | Volume Ratio | Classification |
|------|--------------|--------------|---------------|----------|--------------|----------------|
| ... | ... | $... | $... | ...% | X.Xx (vs 30d avg) | SIGNAL/NOISE/LOW-CONVICTION |

**Classification Rules**:
- **SIGNAL** = Price moved >3% AND volume was >1.5x the 30-day average (use 2% threshold for large caps)
- **LOW-CONVICTION SPECULATION** = Price moved >3% BUT volume was <1.5x the 30-day average (move lacks institutional backing)
- **NOISE** = Price moved <3% or moved opposite to announcement sentiment

### PRICE SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

For EVERY "Signal" announcement (>3% move), verify if the price held its gains:

| Date | Announcement | Price +3 Days | Price +5 Days | Held Gains? | Classification |
|------|--------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| ... | ... | $... | $... | Yes/No | SUSTAINABLE / MEAN REVERSION |

**SUSTAINABLE** = Price held gains for 5+ trading days
**MEAN REVERSION (Pump and Fade)** = Price returned to pre-announcement levels within 5 days

**Pump-to-Hold Ratio**: X sustainable / Y total signals = Z%

### SIGNAL ANNOUNCEMENTS (Price Movers)
List announcements that ACTUALLY moved the share price with evidence:
- Date, headline, price change, why it was material

### NOISE ANNOUNCEMENTS (PR Fluff)
List announcements that had NO material price impact despite positive spin:
- Date, headline, expected vs actual price reaction

### RETAIL TRAP FILTER

**Promotional Language Flags**:
Explicitly identify announcements containing these RED FLAG phrases WITHOUT specific KPI backing or audited financial metrics:
- "Transformational" / "Transformative"
- "World-class" / "World-leading"
- "Next-gen" / "Next-generation"
- "Game-changing" / "Disruptive"
- "Strategic" (without quantified value)
- "Significant" (without dollar amounts)
- "Strong pipeline" (without conversion rates)

| Date | Announcement | Promotional Term | KPI Backing? | TRAP/LEGITIMATE |
|------|--------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| ... | ... | ... | Yes/No | TRAP/LEGITIMATE |

**Retail Trap Score**: X trap announcements / Y total announcements with promotional language

### CRITICAL ANALYSIS: PR vs REALITY

**Company Narrative Credibility Score: X/10**

1. **Track Record of Promises vs Delivery**
   - What did management promise in past announcements?
   - Were those targets met? Evidence from subsequent announcements.

2. **Pattern Detection**
   - Does the company frequently announce "significant" deals that don't move the stock?
   - Are announcements timed to coincide with capital raises or insider activity?

3. **Information Quality**
   - Do announcements contain specific metrics or vague language?
   - Are financial impacts quantified or left ambiguous?

4. **Red Flags Identified**
   - Promotional language without substance
   - Frequent "strategic partnership" announcements with no follow-up
   - Management changes with minimal explanation
   - Dilutive capital raises disguised as "growth funding"

### MANAGEMENT CREDIBILITY GAP AUDIT

Compare the "Strategic Outlook" of the current/recent announcement against reports from 6 and 12 months ago:

1. **6-Month Comparison**:
   - What was promised 6 months ago?
   - What has been delivered/omitted?
   - Credibility Gap: [None / Minor / Significant / Critical]

2. **12-Month Comparison**:
   - What was promised 12 months ago?
   - What has been delivered/omitted?
   - Credibility Gap: [None / Minor / Significant / Critical]

### VANISHING PROMISES TABLE

Identify specific targets or milestones mentioned in past announcements that have been omitted, delayed, or renamed:

| Date | Promise Made (6-12 Months Ago) | Current Status | Credibility Impact |
|------|-------------------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| [Date] | [e.g., "Launching in Q4 2024"] | [e.g., "Delayed to 2026 / Omitted / Renamed to..."] | [Critical/Significant/Neutral] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Vanishing Promise Score**: X broken/delayed promises / Y total promises made = Z%

### FY/EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENT DEEP DIVE

Focus specifically on Financial Year and quarterly earnings announcements (4C, 4E, Annual Reports, Half-Year Results):

| Date | Announcement Type | Key Metrics Disclosed | Price Impact | Vs Prior Guidance |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| ... | FY Results / Half-Year / 4C / AGM | Revenue: $X, NPAT: $X, Cash: $X | +X% / -X% | Beat/Met/Miss |

**Earnings Quality Assessment**:
- **Revenue Growth**: X% YoY - [Accelerating / Decelerating / Stable]
- **Profit Margin Trend**: [Expanding / Stable / Contracting] - evidence
- **Cash Flow Quality**: Operating CF $X vs Reported Profit $X - ratio indicates [Quality/Concern]
- **One-Off Items**: Any non-recurring gains/losses affecting headline results
- **Guidance Reliability**: Has company historically met guidance? [Yes/No/Partial]

**Key Financial Announcement Flags**:
- Did earnings BEAT, MEET, or MISS consensus/guidance?
- Was there a material change in guidance (upgrade/downgrade)?
- Were there any accounting policy changes affecting comparability?
- Is cash conversion (OCF/NPAT) healthy (>80% is good)?

### COMPETITOR & INDUSTRY ALIGNMENT

Compare company's announcement narrative against industry peers and sector reality:

| Factor | Company Claim | Industry Reality | Alignment Status |
|--------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| Market Position | [e.g., "Leading provider"] | [X% market share vs competitors] | [Aligned/Overstated/Understated] |
| Growth Rate | [X% claimed growth] | [Sector average Y%] | [Outperforming/At par/Lagging] |
| Margin Performance | [X% margin] | [Peer average Y%] | [Competitive/Below peers/Above peers] |
| Technology/Product | [Claims made] | [Industry assessment] | [Verified/Unverified/Disputed] |

**Industry Context Assessment**:
- Is the company outperforming or underperforming the {stock:industry} sector?
- Are company-specific challenges being masked as "industry headwinds"?
- Does the growth narrative align with independent market intelligence?
- Are competitors making similar claims (commoditized narrative)?

**Competitive Position Summary**: [LEADER / STRONG / AVERAGE / WEAK / UNKNOWN]
- Evidence: [Specific comparison points]

### INVESTOR INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT**: [CREDIBLE / CAUTIOUS / SKEPTICAL]

- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: X signal announcements / Y total announcements = Z%
- **Low-Conviction Speculation**: X announcements (price moved but low volume - lacks institutional conviction)
- **Pump-to-Hold Ratio**: X% (sustainable gains vs mean reversion)
- **Retail Trap Score**: X% (promotional language without substance)
- **Vanishing Promise Score**: X% (broken/delayed promises)
- **Key Takeaway**: [One sentence on whether to trust company announcements]

---
**CRITICAL RULES**:
- Use ONLY prices from the Stock Data document
- If you cannot find price data for an announcement date, state "Price data unavailable - CANNOT VERIFY"
- Be skeptical - assume all announcements are noise until proven otherwise
- Call out promotional language explicitly
- IF YOU DO NOT HAVE DATA, SAY "UNKNOWN" - never fabricate or estimate
- Adjust volatility threshold based on company size (large caps ~2%, small caps ~5%)
- When comparing outlooks, if historical announcement data is limited, state "Insufficient historical data for credibility gap analysis"
- Flag ALL promotional language - even if the underlying business may be legitimate"""

## PERIOD PERFORMANCE & VOLUME
*DATA EXTRACTION: Find the **Period Changes Summary** line in the Stock Data document. Format: "7D: +X.X%, 1M: +X.X%, 3M: +X.X%, 6M: +X.X%, 1Y: +X.X%, 2Y: +X.X%". Extract each period's value directly. For volume, use "## Volume Analysis" section's "Volume vs Avg" percentage ÷ 100.*

| Period | Change % | Vol vs Avg |
|:-------|:---------|:-----------|
| **7D** | <span style="color:green">▲</span>+X.X% or <span style="color:red">▼</span>-X.X% | - |
| **1M** | <span style="color:green">▲</span>+X.X% or <span style="color:red">▼</span>-X.X% | X.Xx |
| **3M** | <span style="color:green">▲</span>+X.X% or <span style="color:red">▼</span>-X.X% | - |
| **6M** | <span style="color:green">▲</span>+X.X% or <span style="color:red">▼</span>-X.X% | - |
| **1Y** | <span style="color:green">▲</span>+X.X% or <span style="color:red">▼</span>-X.X% | - |
| **2Y** | <span style="color:green">▲</span>+X.X% or <span style="color:red">▼</span>-X.X% | - |

**DATA RULES (CRITICAL)**:
1. **Source**: Find the **Period Changes Summary** line in the Stock Data document. It looks like: "**Period Changes Summary**: 7D: +5.0%, 1M: +16.7%, 3M: +25.0%, 6M: +40.0%, 1Y: +80.0%, 2Y: +120.0%"
2. **Direct Extraction**: The summary line already uses short labels (7D, 1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, 2Y) - extract values directly, no mapping needed
3. **Volume**: Only the 1M row shows Vol vs Avg (current trading activity). Use "Volume vs Avg" percentage ÷ 100 (e.g., 120% → 1.2x, 85% → 0.85x)
4. **Color Formatting**: Output literal HTML - `<span style="color:green">▲</span>+X.X%` for gains, `<span style="color:red">▼</span>-X.X%` for losses
5. **N/A Rule**: ONLY use "N/A" if the period is NOT present in the **Period Changes Summary** line (stock may lack historical data for that period)

**Volume Signal**: If Vol vs Avg > 1.5x, this indicates unusual activity (potential breakout or breakdown).

## COOKED STOCK ANALYSIS
*Identify if the stock is overextended with exhausted technicals where downside risk > upside potential.*

### Extension & Outlook Summary

| Metric | Value | Status |
|:-------|:------|:-------|
| **Extension %** | +X.X% | [Low (<30%) / High (30-50%) / Extreme (>50%)] |
| **RSI (14)** | X.X | [Neutral / Elevated / Overbought (>70)] |
| **Outlook** | *Fresh* / *Mature* / **COOKED** | [Classification] |

**Extension % Calculation**: ((Current Price - SMA 200) / SMA 200) × 100
- **<30%**: Normal trend extension
- **30-50%**: High risk zone - consider **REDUCE**
- **>50%**: Extreme extension - likely **COOKED**
- **>100%**: Critical overextension - *SELL* candidate

### COOKED Criteria Checklist

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|:----------|:-------|:---------|
| **200MA Deviation** | [YES/NO] | Is price >50% above SMA 200? (Extreme extension) |
| **RSI Exhaustion** | [YES/NO] | Is RSI >70 OR showing Bearish Divergence (price ↑, RSI ↓)? |
| **Volume Climax** | [YES/NO] | Was there a massive volume spike followed by stagnant price (churn)? |
| **Signal Decay** | [YES/NO] | Is management releasing "Letter of Interest" or "Non-binding" news into vertical move? |

**COOKED COUNT**: X/4 criteria met

### Outlook Classification

**Outlook Definitions**:
- **Fresh** (*Fresh*): Just broke out, Extension <15%, low RSI, no volume climax
- **Mature** (*Mature*): Healthy trend, Extension 15-30%, SMA 50 holding price
- **COOKED** (**COOKED**): Extension >50%, OR RSI >70, OR 2+ cooked criteria met

### Action Implications

**If COOKED (2+ criteria met)**:
- Recommend *SELL* (italic) - Risk significantly outweighs reward
- Stop loss MUST be tight - any breakdown = immediate exit

**If HIGH RISK (1 criterion met, Extension 30-50%)**:
- Recommend **REDUCE** (bold) - Trim 50% of position
- Trend may still be intact but risk is elevated

**If FRESH/MATURE (0 criteria, Extension <30%)**:
- Standard **BUY**/HOLD analysis applies
- Normal position sizing appropriate

## QUALITY GRADE ANALYSIS
*Classify the stock's fundamental quality based on operational metrics, revenue stability, and management credibility.*

### Quality Classification Summary

| Metric | Assessment | Evidence |
|:-------|:-----------|:---------|
| **Quality Grade** | **QUALITY** / **SPECULATIVE** / **EMPTY** | [Key classification reason] |
| **Revenue Trend** | Growing / Stable / Declining | [YoY evidence from financials] |
| **NPAT/Margins** | Profitable / Breakeven / Loss-making | [Margin trajectory] |
| **Staffing Pattern** | Operational Growth / Stable / Zombie | [Hiring vs firing evidence] |
| **Dilution Risk** | Low / Medium / High / Critical | [Cap raise history] |

### Quality Grade Definitions

**QUALITY** (*Strong fundamentals - compound over time*):
- Stably builds revenue with clear YoY growth trajectory
- Clear operational model with expanding margins or stable profitability
- Rising dividends or NPAT demonstrates shareholder returns
- High Signal/Noise (>50%) - management delivers on promises
- Example indicators: Record revenue, increased staffing, order book growth

**SPECULATIVE** (*Momentum play - trade, don't hold*):
- High momentum or story-driven price action disconnected from operations
- Pre-revenue or volatile earnings with no clear path to profitability
- High "Noise" ratio (<30%) - management relies on PR over delivery
- High dilution risk from frequent placements or non-binding agreements
- Example indicators: Vertical price moves, minimal operational staff, EXIM-style loans

**EMPTY / DEAD** (*Value trap - avoid or exit*):
- Failing business model with declining revenue trajectory
- Constant capital raises with no operational progress
- "Zombie" staff levels - minimal hiring, salvage/reset focus
- Critical gap between management PR (Noise) and operational reality (Signal)
- Example indicators: Project setbacks, feasibility study failures, multi-year losses

### Quality Criteria Evaluation

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|:----------|:-------|:---------|
| **Revenue Growth** | [Positive/Flat/Negative] | [YoY % from financials or "N/A - Pre-revenue"] |
| **Profitability** | [NPAT positive/negative] | [Margin % or loss amount] |
| **Operational Staff** | [Growing/Stable/Shrinking] | [Hiring patterns from announcements] |
| **Cap Raise History** | [None/Occasional/Frequent] | [Last 12 months placement activity] |
| **Signal-to-Noise** | [High/Med/Low] | [From announcement analysis] |
| **Promise Delivery** | [Strong/Mixed/Poor] | [Vanishing promise score from analysis] |

### Quality Verdict
**Grade**: [QUALITY / SPECULATIVE / EMPTY]
**Conviction**: X/10
**Key Evidence**: [1-2 sentence summary of primary classification reason]

## OPPORTUNITY ANALYSIS (6-Month Forecast)
*Evaluate the 6-month opportunity based on volume trends, global tailwinds, and sector positioning.*

### Opportunity Classification

| Factor | Assessment |
|:-------|:-----------|
| **Opportunity Term** | **Growth Consolidation** / **Mean Reversion** / **Cap-Raise Risk** |
| **Expected 6M Movement** | **Bullish (+X-Y%)** / **Bearish (-X-Y%)** / **Flat/Sideways** |
| **Volume Trend** | Accumulating / Distributing / Exhaustion / Stable |

### Opportunity Term Definitions

- **Growth Consolidation**: Healthy pause in uptrend. Volume stabilizing. Fundamentals support continuation. Bullish outlook.
- **Mean Reversion**: Overextended from fundamentals. Volume exhaustion at highs. Price likely to retrace to MA support. Bearish/cautious outlook.
- **Cap-Raise Risk**: Broken technicals or operational setback likely to trigger dilutive capital raise. Flat or downward outlook.

### Tailwind/Headwind Assessment

| Factor | Impact | Evidence |
|:-------|:-------|:---------|
| **Global Tailwinds** | Positive / Neutral / Negative | [e.g., Energy Transition, AI/Data Centers, Uranium deficit] |
| **Sector Positioning** | Leader / Strong / Average / Weak | [Competitive position from analysis] |
| **Macro Environment** | Supportive / Neutral / Adverse | [RBA, inflation, regulatory] |

### Opportunity Rationale
[2-3 sentence explanation combining volume analysis, global tailwinds, and sector position to justify the 6-month outlook]

---

## STRATEGIC JUSTIFICATION

### 1. THE TRADER CASE (1-8 Weeks)
*Focus: Price action relative to SMA 50 + News Catalysts.*
- **Tactical Setup:** [e.g., Pullback to SMA 50, Breakout above Resistance]
- **Catalyst Alignment:** [How recent "Signal" news supports a short-term move]
- **Risk to Trade:** [Specific technical level or news event that voids the trade]

### 2. THE SUPER CASE (6m - 3 Years)
*Focus: SMA 200 Slope + Structural Signal.*
- **Structural Health:** [Is the SMA 200 sloping up? Is the price holding above it?]
- **Fundamental Backing:** [Do the last 6 months of "Signal" announcements suggest a multi-year growth story?]
- **Accumulation Zone:** [Where should long-term investors add to their position?]

---

## THE 200MA "DIP-BUY" CRITICAL CHECKLIST
*Is the current price action a 'Buyable Dip' or a 'Trend Breakdown'?*

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Trend History** | [YES/NO] | Was price above SMA 200 for >70% of the last 6 months? |
| **Volume Quality** | [YES/NO] | Is recent selling on <1.2x average volume? |
| **News Integrity** | [YES/NO] | Have there been ZERO "Negative Signal" news items in 60 days? |
| **Support Test** | [YES/NO] | Is price within 3% of SMA 200 or bouncing off it? |

**DIP-BUY VERDICT:** [BUY THE DIP / WATCH / AVOID - BREAKDOWN IN PROGRESS]

---

## EXECUTION PARAMETERS

| Action | Price Trigger | Rationale |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **ENTRY (Trader)** | $X.XX | [e.g., Break of SMA 50 on Signal News] |
| **ENTRY (Super)** | $X.XX | [e.g., SMA 200 touch or Golden Cross] |
| **STOP LOSS** | $X.XX | [Hard exit if SMA 200 is lost on high volume] |
| **PROFIT TARGET** | $X.XX | [Next major resistance or +20% extension] |

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT & ALTERNATIVES
- **Primary Risk:** [e.g., High Noise ratio suggests management over-compensation]
- **Sector Peer Comparison:** [How does {stock:ticker} compare to sector peers based on current MA alignment?]

---

## REVIEW TRIGGER
**When to Re-Evaluate This Stock:**
- [Specific price level with reasoning, e.g., "Price < $5.75 (SMA200 support level)"]
- [Specific event with reasoning, e.g., "Next Earnings Q2 (guidance update expected)"]
- [Technical trigger with reasoning, e.g., "Break above $12.50 (resistance level - confirms breakout)"]
