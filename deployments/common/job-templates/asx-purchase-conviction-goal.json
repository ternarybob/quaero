Do not skip any stocks.\nThe variables list contains multiple stocks - each one requires individual analysis.\nYour final report MUST include analysis for EVERY stock provided.\n\n=== PHASE 1: INDIVIDUAL DEEP DIVE ===\n\nFor EACH stock in the variables list (you MUST process ALL of them):\n\n1. DATA COLLECTION:\n   - Use fetch_stock_data with period: Y1 for 1-year historical data\n   - Use fetch_announcements with period: Y1 for annual announcements\n   - Use fetch_index_data for XJO benchmark comparison\n   - Use fetch_director_interest to find insider buying/selling activity\n   - Use fetch_macro_data for RBA rates and commodity prices (Iron Ore, Gold)\n\n2. TARGETED WEB SEARCHES (use these specific query recipes):\n   - search_web: \"[TICKER] analyst price target 2025\"\n   - search_web: \"[TICKER] ASX broker upgrade downgrade\"\n   - search_web: \"[TICKER] bear case risks concerns\"\n   - search_web: \"[TICKER] insider buying director trades\"\n\n3. INITIAL ANALYSIS (use analyze_summary for EACH stock):\n   Focus on 3 specific criteria:\n\n   A.

TECHNICAL ENTRY POINTS:\n      - Current price vs SMA20/50/200\n      - Distance from 52-week high/low\n      - Support/resistance levels\n      - RSI14 overbought/oversold status\n\n   C. RISK/REWARD ASSESSMENT:\n      - Upside potential to analyst price targets\n      - Downside risk to support levels\n      - Risk/reward ratio calculation\n\n=== PHASE 2: ADVERSARIAL \"SHORT SELLER\" ANALYSIS ===\n\nCRITICAL: For EACH stock, you MUST act as a hostile short seller.\nYour job is to find EVERY reason NOT to buy this stock.\n\nFor each stock, document:\n\n1. BEAR CASE ARGUMENTS (find at least 3):\n   - Why might this stock fall 20%+?\n   - What are management's blind spots?\n   - What macro risks threaten this business?\n   - What could cause earnings to disappoint?\n   - Is the current valuation justified?\n\n2. RED FLAGS (use fetch_director_interest data to verify):\n   - Insider selling patterns (check Appendix 3Y filings)\n   - Declining margins or revenue\n   - High debt levels\n   - Competitive threats\n   - Regulatory risks\n   - Customer concentration\n   - Directors disposing shares vs acquiring\n\n3. CONTRARIAN VIEW:\n   - Find one bearish analyst view\n   - Find one bullish analyst view\n   - Resolve which is better supported by current cash flow data\n   - Document: \"Bearish view argues X, Bullish view argues Y, Cash flow supports [Bullish/Bearish] because Z\"\n\n4.

Executive Summary\n[2-3 sentences on top picks and market context]\n\n2. Individual Stock Analyses\n\nASX: GNP (GenusPlus Group Ltd)\nFundamental Analysis: GNP is currently valued at a market cap of $1.12B with a P/E ratio of 32.00. While the P/E is elevated, it is supported by an EPS of $0.19 and a dominant position in the Australian power and communications infrastructure sector. The 130% year-over-year growth indicates strong contract execution and market share gains.\nTechnical Analysis: The short-term trend is BEARISH, with the price ($6.13) trading below the 20-day SMA ($6.27) and 50-day SMA ($6.38). However, the long-term trend remains BULLISH as the price is significantly above the 200-day SMA ($4.67). RSI at 45.4 suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory but has not yet bottomed.\nShort Seller Bear Case: Critics argue that the 130% run-up is overextended and that a P/E of 32 is unsustainable for a low-margin infrastructure business. They point to the recent 6% monthly decline as the beginning of a mean reversion toward the $4.67 level.\nAnalyst Resolution: The current pullback is a healthy consolidation following a parabolic move. We view the $5.75 support level as a high-conviction entry point. The long-term infrastructure tailwinds outweigh short-term valuation concerns.\nConviction Score: 82/100\n\nASX: SRL (Sunrise Energy Metals Ltd)\nFundamental Analysis: SRL is currently valued at a market cap of $180M with no P/E ratio (negative earnings). The EPS is -$0.12, reflecting ongoing exploration and development costs. The company holds strategic lithium assets but lacks near-term production revenue.\nTechnical Analysis: The short-term trend is BEARISH, with the price ($0.85) trading below the 20-day SMA ($0.92) and 50-day SMA ($1.05). The long-term trend is also BEARISH as the price is below the 200-day SMA ($1.20). RSI at 38.2 indicates oversold conditions.\nShort Seller Bear Case: Critics argue the lithium price collapse has destroyed the project economics. They point to the 45% decline from 52-week highs and question management's ability to secure project financing in the current environment.\nAnalyst Resolution: This is a speculative hold pending lithium price recovery. We view the $0.75 support level as a potential entry, but recommend waiting for confirmed project financing before accumulating.\nConviction Score: 58/100\n\n[CONTINUE FOR EACH REMAINING STOCK - FOLLOW EXACT FORMAT ABOVE]\n\n3.
