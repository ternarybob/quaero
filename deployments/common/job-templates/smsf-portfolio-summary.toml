You have received:
1. Individual stock analysis reports for multiple ASX stocks (tagged stock-recommendation)

## 30-DAY "IF-THEN" DECISION MATRIX

Provide binary triggers for the next 30 days for each stock:

### ACCUMULATION TRIGGERS (BUY More)
| Ticker | Condition | Action | Target Units |
|--------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| [XXX] | If stays above [SMA 200 = $X.XX] AND [Specific KPI met, e.g., 4C cash flow >$Xm OR revenue target achieved] | BUY [X] additional units | Total: [X] units |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**KPI Examples to Monitor**:
- Quarterly 4C cash flow positive or >$X million
- Revenue run-rate exceeding $X million
- Contract wins valued at >$X million
- Customer acquisition rate above prior quarter

### EXIT TRIGGERS (SELL)
| Ticker | Condition | Action | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|--------|

| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Macro Threshold Triggers**:
- US 10-Year Treasury Yield >4.5% = Sell growth positions (valuation compression)
- US 10-Year Treasury Yield >5.0% = Mandatory 15% cash buffer
- AUD/USD <$0.62 = Review export-exposed holdings
- China PMI <48 = Sell resources/infrastructure exposure

|--------|-----------|-------------------------|
| [XXX] | [Key event/level] | [Condition that changes to BUY or SELL] |

## SMSF LIQUIDITY & CONCENTRATION AUDIT

### Liquidity Stress Test

Identify if the user's position represents >10% of the stock's Average Daily Volume (ADV) and calculate "Days to Exit":

| Ticker | Units Held | Avg Daily Volume | Position as % of ADV | Days to Exit | Liquidity Risk |
|--------|------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|
| [XXX] | X | X | X% | X days | [NORMAL / ELEVATED / HIGH] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Days to Exit Calculation**: Units Held ÷ (ADV × 0.25) = Days (assuming max 25% of daily volume per day)

**Liquidity Risk Classification**:
- **NORMAL** (<1 day): Position can be exited in a single trading session
- **ELEVATED** (1-2 days): Position requires 1-2 days to exit without market impact
- **HIGH LIQUIDITY RISK** (>2 days): Position takes >2 days to exit - requires staged exit strategy

**Liquidity Flags**:
- ⚠️ **HIGH LIQUIDITY RISK** (>2 days to exit): [List tickers] - Staged exit over multiple days required
- ⚠️ **DIFFICULT EXIT** (>10% of ADV): [List tickers] - Single-day exit would significantly impact price
- **Action Required**: [Specific recommendations for illiquid positions]

### Concentration Warning

**Single Stock Concentration Check** (>20% of portfolio = ATO compliance risk):

| Ticker | Current Value | % of Portfolio | Status |
|--------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| [XXX] | $X | X% | [OK / ⚠️ OVER 20%] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Concentration Flags**:
- ⚠️ **ATO COMPLIANCE RISK**: [List tickers exceeding 20%]
- For diversified strategy, holdings >20% require documented justification
- **Recommended Action**: [Rebalancing suggestions]

### SMSF Compliance Summary

Per ATO requirements, SMSF trustees must ensure investments align with documented Investment Strategy:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Growth-oriented (diversified equities with ETF exposure) - [Appropriate / Requires Review]
- **Diversification**: [Adequate / Requires Attention due to concentration]
- **Liquidity**: [Sufficient / Review required due to ADV flags]
- **Single Asset Rule**: [Compliant / Non-compliant]
- **Insurance Needs**: [Consider life insurance requirements]

### Compliance Actions Required
1. [Action 1 - if any concentration issues]
2. [Action 2 - if any liquidity issues]
3. [Action 3 - documentation requirements]
