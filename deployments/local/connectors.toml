# Connector Configuration
#
# This file defines connectors that will be loaded at application startup.
# Each section represents one connector, with the section name as the connector ID/name.
#
# Supported types:
#   github - GitHub connector (requires 'repo' and 'workflow' scopes for action logs)
#   gitlab - GitLab connector
#
# The token field supports variable substitution using {variable_name} syntax.
# Variables are loaded from ./variables/*.toml files.
#
# Example:
#
# [my-github]
# type = "github"
# token = "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
#
# Or with variable reference:
#
# [my-github]
# type = "github"
# token = "{github_token}"

[github]
type = "github"
token = "{github_token}"
