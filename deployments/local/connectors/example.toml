# GitHub Connector Configuration
#
# This file defines GitHub connectors that will be loaded at application startup.
# Each section represents one connector, with the section name as the connector name.
#
# Required fields:
#   type  = "github"  # Connector type
#   token = "..."     # Personal Access Token (PAT)
#
# The token requires 'repo' and 'workflow' scopes for accessing action logs.
#
# To use this example:
# 1. Copy this file to the connectors directory (remove .example extension)
# 2. Replace the token with your actual GitHub PAT
# 3. Restart the application
#
# Example:

[my-github]
type = "github"
token = "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
