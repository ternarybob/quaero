Create a document (in ./docs) which addresses the following issues:

1. On the queue page (./pages/queue.html), the "Show 161 eariler logs" button/link does not action as required. When the user clicks, the logs should simply expand with 100 more eriler logs. Propose solutions to enable users to see all logs, consider that some steps/jobs have +1000 logs, and hence enabling paging or other methods is required.

2. Porpose updates to ./pages/queue.html, to resolve the number of logs displayed, if job log is > 100, should be 100, at least.

3. Popose updates to ./test/ui/job_definition_general_test.go, to test the above, with assertions.
