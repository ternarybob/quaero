## Iteration 1

### Agent 2 - Implementation

Updated all 3 worker implementations to use new JobWorker interface by renaming GetJobType() → GetWorkerType(). Execute() and Validate() method names remain unchanged as they're already clear.

**Changes made:**
All 3 files:
- Renamed method `GetJobType()` → `GetWorkerType()`
- Updated method comments to reflect worker role
- Updated struct comments to emphasize worker responsibilities
- No functional changes to execution logic

**Commands run:**
```bash
go build -o /tmp/test-step10-12 ./cmd/quaero
```
