  Action:\
  - review the code and assess if there is a global limitation
  - update if global limitation, advise defaults, where is set and how to update\
  - otherwise implement fix and test with test\ui\queue_test.go -> TestNewsCrawlerCrash , however create/replicate test with a pass on concurrenty (not crash) i.e. create a new news crawler (or similar) with
  concurrecy > 2 and tests for running
