# CASCADE DELETE IMPLEMENTATION

## Overview

### Problem Statement
Parent jobs in the queue management system could not be deleted when they had child jobs, resulting in orphaned records and incomplete cleanup operations. Users attempting to delete parent jobs would encounter errors or leave dangling child job records in the database.

### Solution
Implemented a hybrid approach combining application-level cascade deletion with database-level foreign key constraints to ensure robust and reliable job hierarchy cleanup.

### Benefits
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned child jobs at the database level
- **Audit Logging**: Application-level cascade logs each deletion for compliance and debugging
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Child jobs are automatically deleted when parent is deleted
- **Fail-Safe Protection**: Database constraints protect against orphaned records even if application logic is bypassed

## Architecture

### Application-Level Cascade (JobManager)

The application layer implements recursive cascade deletion in `internal/jobs/manager.go`:

**Algorithm:**
1. Check for child jobs using `GetChildJobs()`
2. Recursively delete each child (which deletes their children first)
3. Delete the parent job after all children are removed
4. Maximum recursion depth: 10 levels (prevents infinite loops)

**Error Handling Strategy:**
- Non-blocking: If a child deletion fails, log the error and continue with other children
- Best-effort: Attempt to delete the parent even if some children fail
- Aggregated errors: Collect all errors and log total success/failure counts

**Logging Approach:**
```go
// Before cascade
logger.Info().Str("parent_id", jobID).Int("child_count", len(children)).Msg("Cascading delete to child jobs")

// Per child
logger.Debug().Str("parent_id", jobID).Str("child_id", childID).Msg("Deleting child job")

// After cascade
logger.Info().Str("job_id", jobID).Int("children_deleted", successCount).Int("children_failed", errorCount).Msg("Cascade deletion completed")
```

**Maximum Recursion Depth Protection:**
```go
const maxDepth = 10
if depth > maxDepth {
    return fmt.Errorf("maximum recursion depth (%d) exceeded for job %s", maxDepth, jobID)
}
```

### Database-Level Cascade (Foreign Key Constraint)

The database layer enforces referential integrity via foreign key constraint added in Migration 16:

**Foreign Key Constraint:**
```sql
FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES crawl_jobs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```

**ON DELETE CASCADE Behavior:**
When a parent job is deleted, the database automatically:
1. Identifies all child jobs (where `parent_id = parent_job_id`)
2. Recursively deletes children (which triggers cascade for their children)
3. Deletes associated records in `job_logs` and `job_seen_urls` tables

**Interaction with Other FK Constraints:**
The system has three foreign key constraints with CASCADE behavior:
1. `crawl_jobs.parent_id → crawl_jobs.id` (cascade delete children)
2. `job_logs.job_id → crawl_jobs.id` (cascade delete logs)
3. `job_seen_urls.job_id → crawl_jobs.id` (cascade delete URL tracking)

**Why Foreign Keys Were Enabled Globally:**
Previously, `PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF` was set with the comment "this is a temporary document cache". However, the database now stores:
- Job definitions and execution history
- Parent-child job relationships
- Job logs with foreign key references
- URL deduplication with foreign key references

These are relational data requiring referential integrity enforcement. Enabling foreign keys globally ensures all FK constraints are enforced.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

#### 1. internal/jobs/manager.go
- Added recursive cascade deletion logic to `DeleteJob()` method
- Created helper method `deleteJobRecursive()` with depth tracking
- Added comprehensive logging for cascade operations
- Implemented best-effort error handling

**Key Changes:**
```go
// DeleteJob now calls recursive helper
func (m *Manager) DeleteJob(ctx context.Context, jobID string) error {
    return m.deleteJobRecursive(ctx, jobID, 0)
}

// Recursive deletion with depth tracking
func (m *Manager) deleteJobRecursive(ctx context.Context, jobID string, depth int) error {
    // Max depth check, get children, recurse, delete parent
}
```

#### 2. internal/storage/sqlite/schema.go
- Added Migration 16: `migrateEnableForeignKeysAndAddParentConstraint()`
- Cleans up orphaned jobs before adding constraint
- Recreates `crawl_jobs` table with foreign key constraint
- Recreates all indexes
- Verifies constraint was added successfully

**Migration Steps:**
1. Check if migration already applied (idempotent)
2. Clean up orphaned child jobs
3. Create new table with FK constraint
4. Copy all data from old table
5. Drop old table and rename new table
6. Recreate all indexes
7. Verify FK constraint exists

#### 3. internal/storage/sqlite/connection.go
- Changed `PRAGMA foreign_keys` from `OFF` to `ON`
- Updated comment to reflect purpose: referential integrity

**Before:**
```go
"PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF", // Disabled - this is a temporary document cache
```

**After:**
```go
"PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON", // Enabled for referential integrity (CASCADE constraints for jobs, logs, URLs)
```

#### 4. internal/jobs/types/cleanup.go
- Updated `CleanupJobDeps` to use `JobManager` instead of `JobStorage`
- Changed `ListJobs()` and `DeleteJob()` calls to use JobManager
- Ensures cleanup operations benefit from cascade deletion logic

**Impact:**
- All cleanup operations now cascade delete children
- Cleanup logs include cascade deletion messages
- No functional changes to cleanup criteria or logic

#### 5. internal/interfaces/queue_service.go
- Added comprehensive documentation comment to `DeleteJob()` method
- Clarifies cascade deletion behavior
- Documents error handling strategy

### Migration Process

#### Migration 16: Enable Foreign Keys and Add Parent ID Constraint

**Purpose:** Enable foreign key enforcement and add CASCADE constraint to `parent_id`

**Idempotency:**
Checks if FK constraint already exists using `PRAGMA foreign_key_list(crawl_jobs)`. If constraint exists, migration is skipped.

**Orphaned Job Cleanup:**
Before adding the constraint, orphaned child jobs are deleted:
```sql
DELETE FROM crawl_jobs
WHERE parent_id IS NOT NULL
  AND parent_id != ''
  AND parent_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM crawl_jobs WHERE parent_id IS NULL OR parent_id = '')
```

**Table Recreation:**
SQLite doesn't support `ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT`, so the table must be recreated:
1. Create `crawl_jobs_new` with FK constraint
2. Copy all data from `crawl_jobs` to `crawl_jobs_new`
3. Drop `crawl_jobs`
4. Rename `crawl_jobs_new` to `crawl_jobs`
5. Recreate indexes

**Index Recreation:**
All indexes must be recreated after table recreation:
- `idx_jobs_status` - For status and time-based queries
- `idx_jobs_source` - For source type and entity type queries
- `idx_jobs_created` - For creation time queries
- `idx_jobs_parent_id` - For parent-child queries

**Verification:**
After migration completes, verify FK constraint exists by querying `PRAGMA foreign_key_list(crawl_jobs)` and checking for `parent_id` constraint.

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Delete Parent Job with Children
- Create parent job with 3 child jobs
- Delete parent
- Verify all 4 jobs deleted

#### 2. Delete Parent Job with Nested Children (Grandchildren)
- Create job hierarchy: A → B → C
- Delete A
- Verify all 3 jobs deleted
- Verify cascade deletion logged for each level

#### 3. Delete Child Job (No Cascade)
- Create parent with 2 children
- Delete one child
- Verify only child deleted, parent and sibling remain

#### 4. Delete Parent with Running Child
- Create parent (completed) with child (running)
- Delete parent
- Verify child cancelled then deleted
- Verify both jobs removed

#### 5. Partial Cascade Failure
- Create parent with 3 children
- Mock one child deletion to fail
- Verify 2 children deleted successfully
- Verify 1 child deletion failed (logged)
- Verify parent still deleted (best effort)

### Test Files

#### test/api/job_api_test.go
Test cases for cascade deletion should be added to verify:
- API endpoint behavior
- Database state after deletion
- Log entries for cascade operations

**Test Helpers:**
- `createTestJobWithChildren(t, parentID, childCount)` - Helper to create job hierarchy
- `verifyJobDeleted(t, jobID)` - Helper to verify job doesn't exist
- `verifyJobExists(t, jobID)` - Helper to verify job exists
- `countChildJobs(t, parentID)` - Helper to count children

## Deployment Considerations

### Pre-Deployment

1. **Backup Database:**
   ```bash
   cp data/quaero.db data/quaero.db.backup
   ```

2. **Check for Orphaned Jobs:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM crawl_jobs
   WHERE parent_id IS NOT NULL
     AND parent_id != ''
     AND parent_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM crawl_jobs WHERE parent_id IS NULL OR parent_id = '');
   ```

3. **Estimate Migration Time:**
   Migration time scales linearly with job count. For large databases (>10,000 jobs), expect 1-2 seconds per 1,000 jobs.

### Post-Deployment

1. **Verify Foreign Keys Enabled:**
   ```sql
   PRAGMA foreign_keys;
   -- Should return: 1
   ```

2. **Verify Constraint Exists:**
   ```sql
   PRAGMA foreign_key_list(crawl_jobs);
   -- Should show: parent_id | crawl_jobs | CASCADE
   ```

3. **Monitor Deletion Operations:**
   Check logs for cascade deletion messages:
   ```
   level=info msg="Cascading delete to child jobs" parent_id=xxx child_count=N
   level=info msg="Cascade deletion completed" job_id=xxx children_deleted=N children_failed=0
   ```

4. **Check for Orphaned Jobs:**
   After deployment, verify no orphaned jobs exist:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM crawl_jobs
   WHERE parent_id IS NOT NULL
     AND parent_id != ''
     AND parent_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM crawl_jobs WHERE parent_id IS NULL OR parent_id = '');
   -- Should return: 0
   ```

### Rollback Plan

If issues arise after deployment:

1. **Disable Foreign Keys (Temporary):**
   Edit `internal/storage/sqlite/connection.go`:
   ```go
   "PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF",
   ```
   Restart application. This disables FK enforcement but doesn't remove the constraint.

2. **Revert to Previous Version:**
   If disabling FKs doesn't resolve issues, revert to previous application version:
   ```bash
   # Stop application
   # Deploy previous version
   # Restart application
   ```

3. **Restore Database from Backup:**
   If data corruption occurred:
   ```bash
   # Stop application
   cp data/quaero.db.backup data/quaero.db
   # Deploy previous version
   # Restart application
   ```

**Important:** Rollback should only be a temporary measure while fixing the root cause.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: Migration Fails with "FOREIGN KEY constraint failed"

**Cause:** Orphaned jobs still exist after cleanup query

**Solution:**
1. Run orphaned job cleanup query manually:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM crawl_jobs
   WHERE parent_id IS NOT NULL
     AND parent_id != ''
     AND parent_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM crawl_jobs WHERE parent_id IS NULL OR parent_id = '');
   ```
2. Restart application to retry migration

#### Issue: Deletion Takes Too Long

**Cause:** Large number of children (>100 per parent)

**Solution:**
- Increase HTTP timeout in handlers
- Consider batching child deletions
- Monitor logs for progress

#### Issue: Partial Cascade Failure

**Cause:** Child job locked or in use by another process

**Solution:**
1. Check logs for specific error:
   ```
   level=warn msg="Failed to delete child job, continuing" parent_id=xxx child_id=yyy error="..."
   ```
2. Identify locked child job
3. Cancel running jobs first: `PUT /api/jobs/{id}/cancel`
4. Retry deletion

#### Issue: Parent Deleted but Children Remain

**Cause:** Foreign keys not enabled or application logic bypassed

**Solution:**
1. Verify foreign keys enabled:
   ```sql
   PRAGMA foreign_keys;
   ```
2. If disabled, enable in connection.go and restart
3. Manually clean up orphaned children:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM crawl_jobs WHERE parent_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM crawl_jobs);
   ```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Transactional Cascade Deletion:**
   - Current implementation: Each job deletion is atomic, but cascade is not transactional
   - Enhancement: Wrap entire cascade operation in a single transaction (all-or-nothing)
   - Trade-off: Longer lock times, higher risk of deadlock

2. **Soft Delete Option:**
   - Add `deleted_at` timestamp instead of removing records
   - Allows recovery of accidentally deleted jobs
   - Requires UI updates to filter deleted jobs
   - Requires cleanup job to permanently delete old soft-deleted jobs

3. **Cascade Deletion Progress Tracking:**
   - For large hierarchies, provide real-time progress updates
   - WebSocket events for cascade deletion progress
   - UI progress bar showing X of Y children deleted

4. **Bulk Deletion Optimization:**
   - Optimize deletion of multiple parent jobs in a single operation
   - Batch child deletions for better performance
   - Use CTE (Common Table Expression) for recursive deletion in SQL

5. **WebSocket Events for Cascade Deletion:**
   - Broadcast cascade start event: `{"type": "cascade_start", "parent_id": "...", "child_count": N}`
   - Broadcast progress events: `{"type": "cascade_progress", "parent_id": "...", "deleted": N, "remaining": M}`
   - Broadcast completion event: `{"type": "cascade_complete", "parent_id": "...", "total_deleted": N}`

### API Enhancements

1. **Cascade Control Parameter:**
   ```
   DELETE /api/jobs/{id}?cascade=false
   ```
   - Allow disabling cascade for specific deletions
   - Useful for re-parenting children instead of deleting

2. **Dry Run Mode:**
   ```
   DELETE /api/jobs/{id}?dry_run=true
   ```
   - Preview what would be deleted without actually deleting
   - Return list of job IDs that would be affected

3. **Deleted Job IDs in Response:**
   ```json
   {
     "message": "Job deleted successfully",
     "deleted_jobs": ["parent_id", "child1_id", "child2_id"],
     "children_deleted": 2
   }
   ```
