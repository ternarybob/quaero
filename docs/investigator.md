## Codebase Investigator Findings

### Summary of Findings

The codebase for Quaero, a Go-based knowledge search system with a web interface, is generally well-structured, following a layered architecture. However, there are several areas of high complexity and code duplication that could be improved through refactoring.

**Backend:**

The main source of complexity in the backend is the `internal/app/app.go` file, which defines a massive `App` struct that acts as a god object. This struct holds references to all services and handlers, and the `New` function is a large constructor that initializes everything. This makes the application difficult to understand, maintain, and test.

The services in `internal/services` are tightly coupled, with a complex web of dependencies. This makes it difficult to test and maintain the services in isolation.

There is also significant code duplication in the HTTP handlers in `internal/handlers`, especially for validation logic.

**Frontend:**

The frontend uses Alpine.js and is componentized. However, the `pages/static/common.js` file is large and contains complex components with many responsibilities. This makes the frontend code difficult to maintain and debug.

### Refactoring Plan

To address these issues, I propose the following refactoring plan:

**Backend:**

1.  **Break down the `App` god object:** The `App` struct should be broken down into smaller, more focused components. For example, a `ServiceRegistry` could be created to manage the services and their dependencies.
2.  **Use dependency injection:** Instead of manually creating and wiring up the services in the `New` function, a dependency injection container should be used to manage the services and their dependencies. This will make the code more modular and easier to test.
3.  **Simplify the handlers:** The handlers should be simplified by extracting business logic into services. The handlers should be responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses, and nothing more.
4.  **Introduce a service layer:** The business logic should be encapsulated in a service layer. The services should be responsible for a specific domain, and they should be independent of the transport layer (i.e., HTTP).
5.  **Use interfaces to decouple components:** Interfaces should be used to decouple the components from each other. This will make the code more flexible and easier to test.
6.  **Create helper functions to reduce code duplication:** Helper functions should be created to reduce code duplication in the handlers, especially for validation logic.

**Frontend:**

1.  **Break down large Alpine.js components:** The large Alpine.js components in `common.js` should be broken down into smaller, more focused components.
2.  **Use a state management solution:** A state management solution, such as Alpine.js stores, should be used to manage the application's state. This will make the state more predictable and easier to manage.
3.  **Separate API interaction logic:** The API interaction logic should be extracted into a separate module. This would make the components cleaner and easier to test.

### Exploration Trace

*   Used `glob` to get a list of all files in the project.
*   Read `cmd/quaero/main.go` to understand the application entry point.
*   Read `internal/app/app.go` to understand the overall architecture and identify the god object.
*   Used `search_file_content` to find duplicated validation logic in the handlers.
*   Listed the files in the `pages` and `pages/static` directories to understand the frontend structure.
*   Read `pages/index.html` to see the main layout of the application.
*   Read `pages/static/common.js` to understand the frontend logic and identify complex components.
*   Read `pages/static/websocket-manager.js` to understand the WebSocket communication.

### Relevant Locations

*   **C:\development\quaero\internal\app\app.go**
    *   **Reasoning:** This file contains the `App` god object, which is the main source of complexity in the backend. Refactoring this file is the highest priority.
    *   **Key Symbols:** `App`, `New`
*   **C:\development\quaero\internal\handlers**
    *   **Reasoning:** This directory contains the HTTP handlers, which have a lot of duplicated validation logic and are tightly coupled to the services. The handlers should be simplified by extracting business logic to services and using helper functions for common tasks.
    *   **Key Symbols:** (None listed)
*   **C:\development\quaero\internal\services**
    *   **Reasoning:** This directory contains the business logic of the application. The services are tightly coupled and have a complex web of dependencies. They should be refactored to be more modular and independent.
    *   **Key Symbols:** (None listed)
*   **C:\development\quaero\pages\static\common.js**
    *   **Reasoning:** This file contains the main frontend logic. It is a large file with complex Alpine.js components that should be broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces.
    *   **Key Symbols:** `serviceLogs`, `appStatus`, `sourceManagement`, `jobDefinitionsManagement`
