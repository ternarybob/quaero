I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

### Observations

The task addresses two critical performance issues in the Quaero queue management system:

**Backend Issue**: Queue concurrency is set to 5 workers, causing SQLite locking errors under heavy load. SQLite's WAL mode (enabled in config) supports concurrent reads but has limitations with concurrent writes. With 5 workers processing jobs simultaneously, write contention becomes problematic.

**Frontend Issue**: The child jobs list renders all children at once (up to 200 displayed, 1000 fetched), causing:
- DOM bloat with 200+ elements
- Poor UI responsiveness
- Overwhelming visual complexity
- Memory pressure in the browser

**Current Architecture**:
- Queue concurrency: Defined in `internal/queue/config.go` (line 27) and `internal/common/config.go` (line 220)
- Child jobs rendering: Alpine.js component in `pages/queue.html` (lines 262-294, 1274-1471)
- Child jobs are fetched via `loadChildJobs()` with limit of 1000 (line 1443)
- All fetched children are rendered immediately using `x-for` directive (line 269)

**Key Constraints**:
- SQLite busy timeout is 5000ms (5 seconds) - reducing concurrency will decrease lock contention
- WAL mode is enabled for better concurrency, but still has limits
- Child jobs are displayed inline within parent job cards
- Real-time updates via WebSocket must continue to work with pagination

### Approach

**Two-Phase Approach**:

**Phase 1 - Backend**: Reduce queue worker concurrency from 5 to 3 workers to minimize SQLite write contention while maintaining reasonable throughput. This is a conservative middle-ground that balances performance with stability.

**Phase 2 - Frontend**: Implement pagination for child jobs list with "Load More" functionality. This approach is simpler than virtual scrolling, more user-friendly, and maintains compatibility with WebSocket real-time updates. Initial page size of 25 children provides good balance between information density and performance.

### Reasoning

I explored the repository structure, read the queue configuration files (`internal/queue/config.go`, `internal/common/config.go`), examined the queue initialization in `internal/app/app.go`, and analyzed the frontend child jobs rendering logic in `pages/queue.html`. I identified the exact locations where concurrency is configured and where child jobs are rendered, understanding both the current implementation and the performance bottlenecks.

## Proposed File Changes

### internal\queue\config.go(MODIFY)

**Reduce default queue concurrency from 5 to 3 workers**:

1. Locate the `NewDefaultConfig()` function (line 24)
2. Change the `Concurrency` field value from `5` to `3` (line 27)

**Rationale**: 
- SQLite with WAL mode handles concurrent reads well but struggles with concurrent writes
- 5 workers create excessive write contention, causing busy timeout errors
- 3 workers provide a balance between throughput and stability
- This is a conservative reduction that can be tuned further if needed
- Users can still override via `QUAERO_QUEUE_CONCURRENCY` environment variable if they have different requirements

**Impact**:
- Reduces SQLite locking errors significantly
- Slightly increases job processing time (acceptable tradeoff)
- Maintains reasonable throughput for typical workloads

### internal\common\config.go(MODIFY)

References: 

- internal\queue\config.go(MODIFY)

**Update default queue concurrency in main config to match queue config**:

1. Locate the `NewDefaultConfig()` function (line 210)
2. Find the `Queue` configuration section (lines 218-224)
3. Change the `Concurrency` field value from `5` to `3` (line 220)

**Rationale**:
- Maintains consistency with `internal/queue/config.go`
- Both files define default concurrency, so they must match
- This is the configuration that gets loaded by the application

**Note**: The comment on line 208 states "Technical parameters are hardcoded here for production stability" - this change aligns with that philosophy by choosing a more stable default value.

### pages\queue.html(MODIFY)

**Implement pagination for child jobs list with "Load More" functionality**:

**1. Add pagination state to Alpine.js `jobList` component** (around line 1271):
   - Add `childJobsPageSize: 25` - Number of children to show per page
   - Add `childJobsVisibleCount: new Map()` - Map of parentId -> number of visible children
   - Initialize visible count to `childJobsPageSize` for each parent when expanded

**2. Modify `loadChildJobs()` function** (lines 1439-1471):
   - Reduce the fetch limit from `1000` to `500` (line 1443) to prevent excessive data transfer
   - When storing children in `childJobsList`, initialize the visible count for this parent to `childJobsPageSize`
   - Keep the full list in `childJobsList` but only render a subset

**3. Add helper function `getVisibleChildJobs(parentId)`**:
   - Returns a slice of `childJobsList.get(parentId)` from index 0 to `childJobsVisibleCount.get(parentId)`
   - Handles cases where visible count exceeds total children
   - This function will be called in the template to get the subset to render

**4. Add helper function `loadMoreChildJobs(parentId)`**:
   - Increases `childJobsVisibleCount` for the given parent by `childJobsPageSize`
   - Caps at the total number of children available
   - Triggers re-render via `this.renderJobs()`

**5. Modify child jobs rendering section** (lines 262-294):
   - Change the `x-for` directive from `child in childJobsList.get(item.job.id)` to `child in getVisibleChildJobs(item.job.id)`
   - This ensures only the visible subset is rendered in the DOM

**6. Add "Load More" button after the child jobs list** (after line 292):
   - Add a conditional template that shows when `childJobsVisibleCount.get(item.job.id) < childJobsList.get(item.job.id).length`
   - Button text: "Load More (showing X of Y)"
   - Button click handler: `@click.stop="loadMoreChildJobs(item.job.id)"`
   - Style the button to match existing Bulma CSS patterns

**7. Update `handleChildSpawned()` function** (lines 1303-1328):
   - When a new child is added to the list, check if the parent's visible count needs initialization
   - If the parent is expanded and visible count is not set, initialize it to `childJobsPageSize`
   - Ensure new children appear in the visible set if there's room

**8. Update header text** (line 266):
   - Change from `'Spawned URLs (' + childJobsList.get(item.job.id).length + ')'`
   - To: `'Spawned URLs (showing ' + getVisibleChildJobs(item.job.id).length + ' of ' + childJobsList.get(item.job.id).length + ')'`
   - This provides clear feedback about pagination state

**Benefits of this approach**:
- **Simple implementation**: No complex virtual scrolling library needed
- **User-friendly**: Clear "Load More" button with progress indicator
- **Performance**: Only renders 25 children initially, reducing DOM size by 87% (25 vs 200)
- **WebSocket compatible**: Real-time updates continue to work, new children appear at the top
- **Progressive disclosure**: Users can load more if needed, but most won't need to
- **Memory efficient**: Fetches 500 instead of 1000, but still enough for most use cases

**Alternative considered - Virtual scrolling**:
- Pros: Better performance with very large lists, smooth scrolling
- Cons: Complex implementation, requires scroll container height calculations, harder to maintain, potential issues with WebSocket updates
- Decision: "Load More" is simpler and sufficient for this use case
