  "notes": "Exceptional analysis work. The logging-analysis.md document provides a complete, accurate, and well-structured investigation of the logging architecture. Key strengths:\n\n1. **Comprehensive Data Flow**: Complete trace from service code → Arbor → LogService → EventService → WebSocket → UI with exact line numbers\n\n2. **Configuration Analysis**: Documented the full configuration flow including parsing logic (lines 312-325), filtering logic (lines 327-332), and event publishing (lines 447-466)\n\n3. **Accurate Code Locations**: All referenced code locations verified:\n   - test-config.toml line 12: min_event_level='debug' ✓\n   - service.go lines 312-325: parseLogLevel function ✓\n   - service.go lines 327-332: shouldPublishEvent filtering ✓\n   - service.go line 417: Filter check in consumer ✓\n   - websocket.go lines 762-805: WebSocket subscription ✓\n   - common.js lines 27-178: Alpine.js serviceLogs component ✓\n\n4. **Key Finding**: Correctly identified that debug logs WILL appear when min_event_level='debug' because the filtering uses numeric comparison (DebugLevel >= DebugLevel = true)\n\n5. **Timestamp Verification**: Documented that timestamps are server-formatted (HH:MM:SS) and preserved through the entire flow, not calculated client-side\n\n6. **Actionable Recommendations**: Provided specific JavaScript code examples for step 3 test implementation\n\n7. **Architecture Status**: Correctly concluded that the architecture is properly implemented with no bugs or misconfigurations\n\nThe analysis provides a solid foundation for implementing the test in step 3.",
