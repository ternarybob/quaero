  Problem : The concurrancy setting in the job config, does not seem to work. Only 1-2 jobs are running at one time.

  bin\job-definitions\news-crawler.toml

  bin\job-definitions\github-repo-collector.toml
  C:/Users/bobmc/Pictures/Screenshots/ksnip_20251128-194615.png

  Action:
  - review the code and assess if there is a global limitation
  - update if global limitation, advise defaults, where is set and how to update
  - implement fix and test with test\ui\queue_test.go -> TestNewsCrawlerCrash , however create/replicate test with a pass on concurreny (not crash) i.e. create a new news crawler (or similar) with
  concurrecy > 2 and tests for running 
  - the github-repo-collector is downloading > 900 documents, and hence higher concurrency would be better.

Note: there maybe a better way to process github-repo-collector, as it takes more time than a "git clone" operation.
