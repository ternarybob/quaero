# Step 1 (Iteration 1)

## Inputs

- Workdir manifest: `docs/feature/20251213-docsfeatureprompt-6/manifest.md`
- Request reference: `docsfeatureprompt_6.md` (**missing**)

## Architecture Docs Re-Read

- `docs/architecture/manager_worker_architecture.md`
- `docs/architecture/QUEUE_LOGGING.md`
- `docs/architecture/QUEUE_UI.md`
- `docs/architecture/QUEUE_SERVICES.md`
- `docs/architecture/workers.md`

## Implementation

No code changes implemented in iteration 1.

### Blocker

The referenced request file `docsfeatureprompt_6.md` does not exist in the repository, and there is no alternative prompt content elsewhere in the repo matching that name/pattern.

## Build/Tests (Allowed Paths Only)

Planned to run once the request is available and code changes exist.

## Notes

- `openspec/AGENTS.md` is not present in this repo; any instructions that require opening it cannot be satisfied until the file exists.
