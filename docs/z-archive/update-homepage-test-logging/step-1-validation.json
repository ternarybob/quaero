  "notes": "Step 1 implementation is complete and validates successfully. The test file is properly located in test/ui/, compiles without errors, and passes all test assertions. The Service Logs Component subtest successfully verifies the Alpine.js serviceLogs component exists on the homepage and extracts the logs count (81 entries found). Test results and screenshots are properly saved to timestamped results directory. Code follows existing test patterns with proper error handling, logging via env.LogTest, and graceful handling of edge cases (empty logs). The implementation correctly uses chromedp.Evaluate with JavaScript to access Alpine.js reactive data via Alpine.$data API.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Consider reducing the 2-second sleep time (line 174) to 1 second for faster test execution if Alpine.js initialization is reliably quick",
    "Could add assertion for minimum log count (e.g., > 0) instead of just warning, if logs are expected to be populated by this point in the test"
