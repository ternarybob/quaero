3. POSITION SIZING:
   - Calculate weight of each holding (by value or equal weight)
   - Flag any holding > 15% of portfolio (concentration risk)
   - Flag any holding > 25% as CRITICAL concentration

=== SECTOR DIVERSIFICATION ===

4. SECTOR BREAKDOWN:
   - Group holdings by sector/industry

     * 4-6: Moderate (40-60% in top sector)
     * 7-10: Good (<40% in any single sector)

=== QUALITY DISTRIBUTION ===

5. QUALITY ANALYSIS:
   - Count holdings by quality grade (A/B/C/D/F)
   - Quality-weighted portfolio score

   Compliance Notes:
   - Diversification adequacy for SMSF
   - Single-asset concentration warnings
   - Arm's length requirement considerations

=== PRIORITY ACTIONS ===

8. ACTION LIST:
