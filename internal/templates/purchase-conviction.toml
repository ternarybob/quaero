Identify the BEST purchase opportunities from the provided stock data.
This is a PURCHASE DECISION analysis - find stocks worth buying NOW.

CRITICAL: Analyze ALL stocks in the data. Each requires individual analysis.

=== PHASE 1: INDIVIDUAL DEEP DIVE ===

For EACH stock:

1. FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS:
   - Market cap, P/E ratio, EPS
   - Revenue trajectory and growth rates
   - Profit margins and trends
   - Upcoming catalysts (FY/HY results, contracts)
   - Dividend history and yield

2. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
   - Current price vs SMA20/50/200
   - RSI14 position (overbought/neutral/oversold)
   - Support and resistance levels
   - Distance from 52-week high/low
   - Volume patterns and momentum

3. RISK/REWARD ASSESSMENT:
   - Upside potential to analyst price targets
   - Downside risk to support levels
   - Risk/reward ratio calculation

=== PHASE 2: ADVERSARIAL "SHORT SELLER" ANALYSIS ===

CRITICAL: For EACH stock, act as a hostile short seller.
Your job is to find EVERY reason NOT to buy this stock.

1. BEAR CASE (find at least 3 reasons):
   - Why might this stock fall 20%+?
   - What are management's blind spots?
   - What macro risks threaten this business?
   - What could cause earnings to disappoint?
   - Is the current valuation justified?

2. RED FLAGS (check carefully):
   - Insider selling patterns (director trades)
   - Declining margins or revenue
   - High debt levels
   - Competitive threats emerging
   - Regulatory risks
   - Customer concentration
   - Accounting irregularities

3. CONTRARIAN VIEW:
   - Find one bearish analyst view
   - Find one bullish analyst view
   - Resolve which is better supported by data
   - Document: "Bearish argues X, Bullish argues Y, data supports [view] because Z"

4. SHORT SELLER VERDICT:
   - If NO strong bear case found → STRONG BUY signal
   - If compelling bear case → AVOID or reassess entry point
   - Rate "Short Seller Confidence" 1-10 (higher = more reasons to short)

=== PHASE 3: CONVICTION SCORING ===

Calculate weighted score for EACH stock (total = 100 points):

| Component    | Weight | Score | Weighted |
|--------------|--------|-------|----------|
| Fundamental  | 35%    | X/10  | X × 3.5  |
| Technical    | 25%    | X/10  | X × 2.5  |
| Risk         | 25%    | X/10  | X × 2.5  |
| Insider      | 10%    | X/10  | X × 1.0  |
| Macro        | 5%     | X/10  | X × 0.5  |
| **TOTAL**    | 100%   |       | **X/100** |

Component definitions:
- Fundamental: Catalysts, growth quality, earnings sustainability
- Technical: Entry point quality, trend strength, momentum
- Risk: Inverted short seller score (low bear case = high score)
- Insider: Director interest filings (buying = positive, selling = negative)
- Macro: RBA rate impact, commodity correlation, sector tailwinds

=== TIER ASSIGNMENT ===

Based on conviction score:
- TIER 1 (80-100): **BUY** - Strong conviction, immediate purchase candidate
- TIER 2 (60-79): **BUY** - Good conviction, buy on weakness/pullback
- TIER 3 (40-59): **HOLD** - Neutral, wait for better entry or catalyst
- TIER 4 (<40): **AVOID** - Negative conviction, do not purchase

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

2. INDIVIDUAL STOCK ANALYSES (for EACH stock):
   - Ticker and company name
   - Fundamental analysis paragraph
   - Technical analysis paragraph
