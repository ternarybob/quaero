   - Use fetch_stock_data with period: Y5 for 5-year historical data
   - Captures: prices, volume, technical indicators, period performance

   - HIGH SIGNAL: Material financial data (FY/HY results, earnings guidance, major contracts, M&A)
   - MEDIUM SIGNAL: Operational updates, board changes, strategy updates
   - LOW SIGNAL (NOISE): Generic PR, routine notices, administrative filings
   Cross-reference price-sensitive flags and stock price movement on announcement dates.
   Calculate signal-to-noise ratio for the company's communication style.

6. FY/HY RESULTS DEEP DIVE
   Locate the most recent FY or HY results announcement and analyze:
   - KEY POSITIVES (list 3-5): Revenue growth, margin improvement, cash flow, strategic wins

   - YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISON: Revenue, NPAT, EPS, dividend changes
   - MANAGEMENT OUTLOOK: Guidance, tone, and confidence level

7. 5-YEAR COMPANY PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
   Using historical stock data, analyze long-term trajectory:

   - PRICE VS MARKET: Performance vs ASX 200 (XJO) benchmark
   - VOLUME TRENDS: Institutional interest changes over time
   Note: Revenue/profit progression requires web search for historical financials.

8. COMPANY QUALITY ASSESSMENT
   Rate overall company quality (A/B/C/D/F) based on fundamental strength:
   - REVENUE TRAJECTORY: Growing, stable, or declining over 3-5 years
   - PROFIT TRAJECTORY: NPAT/margin trends, path to profitability
   - SHARE PRICE TRAJECTORY: Long-term capital appreciation vs destruction
   - QUALITY SCORE: A (excellent fundamentals), B (good), C (average), D (weak), F (poor/speculative)

   Quality Rating Criteria:
   - A: Consistent revenue AND profit growth, share price appreciation, strong balance sheet
   - B: Mostly positive trends with minor concerns
   - C: Mixed results, some growth but also challenges
   - D: Declining trends in multiple areas, turnaround needed
   - F: Speculative, pre-revenue, or deteriorating fundamentals
