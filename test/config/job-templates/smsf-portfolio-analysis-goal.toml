Perform a comprehensive SMSF portfolio review for all holdings in the variables list.

IMPORTANT: The portfolio may contain 1 or more stocks. Adjust analysis appropriately:
- For single-stock portfolios: Focus on that stock's performance and risk concentration
- For multi-stock portfolios: Include diversification and correlation analysis

=== PHASE 1: DATA COLLECTION ===

1. STOCK DATA: For EACH holding in variables:
   - Use fetch_stock_data with period: Y5 for 5-year historical data
   - Captures: current price, OHLCV history, technical indicators, period performance

2. ANNOUNCEMENTS: For EACH holding:
   - Use fetch_announcements with period: Y1 for annual announcements
   - Captures: FY/HY results, trading updates, material contracts

3. BENCHMARK DATA:
   - Fetch ASX 200 (XJO) for large cap comparison
   - Fetch Small Ords (XSO) for small cap comparison

4. NEWS: Search for financial news on each holding
   - Use search_web for analyst coverage, broker notes

=== PHASE 2: PROFIT & LOSS ANALYSIS ===

5. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (for EACH holding):
   - Current Price: from stock data
   - Cost Basis: Units × Avg Purchase Price (from variables)
   - Current Value: Units × Current Price
   - Unrealized P/L: Current Value - Cost Basis
   - Return %: (Current Value - Cost Basis) / Cost Basis × 100
   - Contribution: Holding's % of total portfolio gain/loss

6. TOTAL PORTFOLIO P/L:
   - Sum of all Cost Bases = Total Investment
   - Sum of all Current Values = Total Portfolio Value
   - Total Unrealized P/L = Total Value - Total Investment
   - Overall Return % = Total P/L / Total Investment × 100

=== PHASE 3: PORTFOLIO MIX ANALYSIS ===

7. DIVERSIFICATION ASSESSMENT:
   - Industry concentration: % in each industry/sector
   - Single-stock risk: Flag any holding >20% of portfolio
   - Sector correlation: How holdings might move together
   - For single-stock portfolio: Emphasize concentration risk

8. COMPANY QUALITY ASSESSMENT (for EACH holding):
   - Revenue trajectory (growing/stable/declining)
   - Profit trajectory (NPAT/margin trends)
   - Quality Grade: A (excellent) / B (good) / C (average) / D (weak) / F (speculative)

9. PORTFOLIO MIX RATING:
   - DEFENSIVE: % in ETFs, bonds, cash, blue chips
   - GROWTH: % in small caps, technology, emerging
   - INCOME: Dividend yield of portfolio
   - Risk Profile: Conservative / Balanced / Aggressive

=== PHASE 4: RECOMMENDATIONS ===

10. DUAL RECOMMENDATIONS (for EACH holding):

    TRADER VIEW (1-6 weeks):
    - Focus: Technical momentum, near-term catalysts
    - Action: STRONG BUY / BUY / HOLD / SELL / STRONG SELL
    - Conviction: 1-10

    SUPER VIEW (6-12+ months):
    - Focus: Company quality, long-term value, SMSF suitability
    - Action: ACCUMULATE / HOLD / REDUCE / AVOID
    - Conviction: 1-10
    - Only recommend ACCUMULATE for Quality A or B companies

11. PORTFOLIO ACTIONS:
    - Rebalancing recommendations if any holding drifted from target weight
    - Add/trim suggestions based on quality and valuation
    - SMSF compliance notes (diversification rules, arm's length requirements)

=== PHASE 5: SYNTHESIS ===

If data is missing for any stock:
- Calculate what you can with available data
- Note missing data explicitly
- Continue with remaining analysis

FINAL OUTPUT MUST INCLUDE:

1. PORTFOLIO VALUATION TABLE:
   Ticker | Units | Avg Cost | Current | Value | P/L | Return% | Weight
